<p id="description">This project is still in the very early stages of development. It still lacks many features and probably has a few bugs and performance problems.</p>

<h2>ü§ì Technical information:</h2>

This program works with [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), an open source text recognition software. hsrpc extracts no data from the game and is based solely on what tesseract recognizes on the window (so some results may be wrong)

<h3>App folder</h3>

This app create a folder `hsrpc` inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming`. This folder is user to store config, logs and files needed to make this app working.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning‚ö†Ô∏è for now, if a new value is added to the configuration between 2 versions and the config file already exists this causes crashes. So remember to backup and delete your `config.txt` file when updating the application.**

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Install tesseract-ocr</p>

[tesseract github](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-tesseract)

or with choco

```
choco install tesseract
```

<p>2. Download hsrpc.exe</p>

Download the file named `hsrpc_windows_amd64.zip` and extract the executable (.exe) to the desired location

[Latest release](https://github.com/X3ne/hsrpc/releases/latest)

<p>3. Launch</p>

Just run the executable and off you go

<h2>üèóÔ∏è Build Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone this project</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/X3ne/hsrpc
```

<p>2. Install go-winres</p>

```
go install github.com/tc-hib/go-winres@latest
```

<p>3. Run go generate (used to bundle static files and set executable icon)</p>

```
go generate ./...
```

<p>4. Build</p>

```
go build -ldflags="-X github.com/X3ne/hsrpc/src/consts.Version=X.X.X -H=windowsgui"
```

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Configuration:</h2>

When you launch the `.exe` file you can configure some settings with the GUI app. To open the GUI just go to your **windows systray** and **right click** to open the config.

<h3>Settings:</h3>

**Loop time**: This is the time that elapses between two loop executions. If you're experiencing performance issues, you can increase this value (in milliseconds).

**Preprocess treshold**: You can adjust this value by checking screenshots inside `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\hsrpc\tmp` (you need to see the text on the images when using the app). If you have `Lost in the space-time continuum` status this means you may need to lower this value.

<h2>ü™≤ Known issues:</h2>

IMPORTANT:
- [ ] Merge config file to avoid application crashes when config changes between different versions

Menus:
- [ ] Data bank tab is not detected
- [ ] Achievements tab is not detected
- [ ] Unfortunately, the new update has broken other menus for no reason (only on resolutions below 2560)

- [ ] Fix gosec errors
- [ ] Sometimes, the position of the selected character is not the right one (especially when the background is too bright, e.g. on Jarilo-VI when there's snow in the background)
- [ ] I don't have these characters, but `Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae` and `Topaz and Numby` seem sus names for ocr detection.

<h2>‚öíÔ∏è Improvements:</h2>

- [x] Add support for more game resolution (tested with fullscreen 1920x1080, 2560x1080 & windowed 1768x992)
- [x] Add more game menus status
- [ ] Clean some code
- [x] Create scripts to create data csv
- [x] Build to .exe
- [ ] Add support for Simulated Universe
- [ ] Add support for Calyx
- [ ] Add support for Cavern of corrosion
- [ ] Add support for Echo of war
- [ ] Add support for cut scenes
- [ ] Add support for the Trailblazer
- [ ] I want to add more infos for the selected character in the character tab (like the character name, level...)
- [x] Auto calculate coords based on app resolution
- [ ] Reimplement the personalization of coordinates in GUI

GUI app:
- [x] Add persistent state to GUI configuration
- [ ] Add field validation
